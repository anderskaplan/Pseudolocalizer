Pseudolocalizer
===============
The Pseudolocalizer is a tool for testing internationalization aspects of software. Specifically, it reads string values from resource files in the Resx format and generates fake translations for the "qps-ploc" pseudo-locale.

The tool is run from the command line and provides the following options for the fake translation:

- Add accents on all letters so that non-localized text can be spotted -- but without making the text unreadable.
- Make all words 30% longer, to ensure that there is room for translations.
- Add brackets to show the start and end of each localized string.
  This makes it possible to spot strings that have been cut off.
- Reverse all words ("mirror"), to simulate right-to-left locales.
- Replace all characters with underscores so that non-localized text can be spotted.
